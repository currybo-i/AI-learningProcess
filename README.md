# AI-learningProcess
a c++ AI framework project, all of it done from scratch, and to learn AI under the hood

BackStory, I am a undergrad cs student (as for 15/07/25), I like watching 3blue1brown, branch education, and other similar yt channels, it just always interested me so much :), as its probably obvious, english is not my native, I can't talk so confidently that I am typing the right thing to say, I can't be more of a nonchalant (?) person like "Durh bara like ami ki ar bolbo ;0 " (It is in Bengali), tbh I am like one of those students, comp sc. marks are 10/10 but rest... avg :l, but other than that, I am gay, I like cold choco (a lot)(cold specifically, hot is meh)

About this project
As I said, I like computers, it always bugged me how AI worked, so, after getting inspired by the 3Blue1Brown ML series, I started making my own small AI, but when I already have started making, I realised there were modules like pytorch and tensorflow for my use, but... meh, went with my own anyway, and so I made a small py AI framework maybe at jan 2025? I don't really remember when I did, So its with the same logic, just the new thing is cpp and Matrix, which I haven't any idea of what it does actually (I was reading in class 11, a.k.a. pre calculas), I just used to imagine it as a 2d array, but now that I know what it is, and why 3Blue1Brown was using it in their series, it motivated me to remake it again but I also was going to learn cpp, so maybe it is more efficient if I just charge straight into both :)
so its a copy of that old framework, logic to logic, didn't had to think that much tbh

26.6% copilot usage, tbh, it has only been used to structure the repeatative work U_U I think it is fair that way
I had fun, cya
